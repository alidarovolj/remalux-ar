      "1": {
        "title": "What is water-based paint?",
        "answer": "Water-based paint is a paint where water is the main solvent. It forms an emulsion of water and binding agent, making the paint safe and convenient to use."
      },
      "2": {
        "title": "Can water-based paint be used for exterior work?",
        "answer": "Yes, there is a special water-based paint for exterior work that has increased resistance to rain, snow, and sunlight. You can use facade paint, satin, or textured paint."
      },
      "3": {
        "title": "What are the main advantages of REMALUX paints?",
        "answer": "They dry quickly, have no odor, are easy to apply, are safe for health and the environment, and do not emit toxic substances."
      },
      "4": {
        "title": "What types of water-based paints are available?",
        "answer": "Water-based paints are available in acrylic, latex, silicone, and other polymer bases. The choice depends on operating conditions and surface requirements."
      },
      "5": {
        "title": "Which water-based paint should I choose for apartment walls?",
        "answer": "For interior work, it's better to choose PRO paint, universal paint, or interior paint, as they have good vapor permeability and are easy to clean."

      },
      "7": {
        "title": "What does 'matte' or 'glossy' surface mean?",
        "answer": "Matte paint doesn't reflect light, creating a velvety surface that hides imperfections (PRO paint, universal, interior). While glossy gives walls shine (satin, kitchen and bathroom paint, metal and wood paint) requires a perfectly smooth surface as it will show all imperfections."
      },
      "8": {
        "title": "How to properly prepare the surface before applying water-based paint?",
        "answer": "The surface should be clean, dry, and smooth. If necessary, remove old paint, smooth out cracks and seams, then apply primer. Humidity should not be above 80%, and temperature above +10°C."
      },
      "9": {
        "title": "What is the consumption of water-based paint per 1 m²?",
        "answer": "Usually consumption is about 100-150 ml per 1 m², depending on the surface type and chosen paint. Per one layer."
      },
      "10": {
        "title": "Can water-based paint be applied in multiple layers?",

      "11": {
        "title": "How long does water-based paint take to dry?",
        "answer": "Drying time depends on temperature and humidity, but usually paint dries from 2 hours."
      },
      "12": {
        "title": "Which water-based paint is most resistant to dirt?",
        "answer": "PRO and satin paints, facade paint, and metal and wood paint have good resistance to dirt and can be cleaned from dust and grime."

      },
      "18": {
        "title": "Why is water-based paint better than oil-based paint?",
        "answer": "Water-based paints are easier to apply, dry faster, don't have a strong odor, and are safer for health than oil-based paints."
      },
      "19": {
        "title": "How to store water-based paint?",
